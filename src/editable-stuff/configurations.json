  "aboutDev": "I was born to two loving immigrant parents that knew practically nothing about technology and the modern world. While growing up, I was enamored by the technological feats achieved and I desperately wanted to be part of it. I joined an articulation program with Brooklyn College where I would complete all the technical aspects of Engineering there and proceed in pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering at NYU. ",
